# Discovering-faster-matrix-multiplication-algorithm-with-optimization

Inspired by the outstanding paper ["AlphaTensor: Discovering faster matrix multiplication algorithms with reinforcement learning"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05172-4), in this repo I used pyomo library and IPOPT optimizer to solve the problem of finding a correct matrix multiplication algorithm with a predifined number of scalar multiplications.
